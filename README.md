This system monitor will continuously monitor the CPU, memory, and disk usage of your Linux system and display the usage percentages. If any of the thresholds for CPU, memory, or disk usage are exceeded, an alert will be sent. You can customise the threshold values as per your requirements and add your own logic to send alerts.

To save the system_monitor.sh file,

**What Does the Code in System_monitor.sh do?**

#!/bin/bash: This line specifies that the script will be interpreted using the Bash shell.
CPU_THRESHOLD=80: Sets the CPU usage threshold to 80%. You can adjust this value later.
MEMORY_THRESHOLD=80 and DISK_THRESHOLD=80: Similarly, these define thresholds for memory and disk usage.

send_alert: The function takes two arguments:
$1 represents the resource type (e.g., CPU, Memory, Disk).
$2 represents the current usage percentage.
tput setaf 1: Changes the text color to red to make alerts visually distinct.
tput sgr0: Resets the text formatting to normal after the alert message.

top -bn1: Runs the top command in batch mode for one iteration to fetch real-time CPU stats.
grep "Cpu(s)": Filters the output to focus on the CPU usage line.
awk '{print $2+$4}': Extracts and sums the percentages of user and system CPU usage.
cpu_usage=${cpu_usage%.*}: Strips the decimal part to simplify threshold comparisons.
if ((cpu_usage >= CPU_THRESHOLD)): Compares the CPU usage with the threshold and calls send_alert if itâ€™s exceeded.
